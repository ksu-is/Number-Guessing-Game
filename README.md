# Number-Guessing-Game
As the title implies, it's a guessing game based off numbers.

# Project Description
The Number Guessing Game is a Python-based GUI app where players try to guess a randomly chosen number within a set range. Players select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard), receive feedback after each guess, and can restart the game anytime using the "Play Again" button.

The goal of the Number Guessing Game is to challenge your mind by guessing the secret number in as few attempts as possible. It’s a fun and addictive way to sharpen your logical thinking and pattern recognition skills—perfect for quick mental workouts or friendly competition.
